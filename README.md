# pc2_final_project

## Instructions to run: 

1. The first thing is to run `docker-compose up` to mount the container with the three images.
2. In the command line, you'll see a URL directing to the Jupyter Notebook (which is inside the ./work file).
3. To see the Dash server in browser, you'll have to enter `localhost:8050`. 

## To run in play with docker: 

1. Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/alX-u/pc2_final_project`
2. Enter the pc2_final_project directory: `cd pc2_final_project`
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Wait for everything to download and set up and then you can acces the ports in which the Jupyter Notebooks and the Dash server are running. (You can access to those ports right there in the Play With Docker page)
5. To access the Jupyter Notebooks input the token 'easy'.
