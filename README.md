# pc2_final_project

##Instructions to run: 

1. The first thing is to run `docker-compose up` to mount the container with the three images.
2. In the command line, you'll see a URL directing to the Jupyter Notebook (which is inside the ./work file).
3. You'll also see the URL to the Dash server which contains the graphics for each of our visualizations.
